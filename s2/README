This directory contains a fork of the S2 library available here:

https://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library

The files have been modified to properly compile on OS X (fixing a hash_map
and hash_set incompatibility) as well as removing the dependencies on the
exact_float and strings libraries.  The former is necessary for testing
co-linearity of points separated by large distances on the sphere, but is
generally unnecessary for astronomical use cases.  The strings library is mainly
needed to tokenize s2cells.  This functionality is currently disabled (hence,
removing the necessity for including the strings library), but may be added at
some future date.

Additionally, we have replaced the Makefile in the standard distribution with
an autoconf-style Makefile.am file so that we can incorporate this package into
the rest of STOMP more readily.  Likewise, in doing so, we have changed the
resulting library structure to store all of the S2 functionality into a single
library for linking rather than the multiple libraries generated by the original
Makefile.
